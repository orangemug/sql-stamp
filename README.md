# sql-stamp
The tiny SQL templating library, with the aim to be as simple as possible so to not get in the way of you writing SQL.

It supports the following conditionals:

 * `{=key, optionalDefault}`  - Turns args into `?` with an optional default
 * `{!key, optionalDefault}` - Passed raw into the SQL
 * `{?key, replaceTruthy, replaceFalsey}` - Ternary switch, the defaults are replaceTruthy/replaceFalsey === true/false
 * `{>path, optionalDataKeys*}` - Require file from the templates, the data keys can take on the format
   * `{>path id:user.id}` - pass `user.id` as `id`
   * `{>path user.id}` - pass `user.id` as `id`
   * `{>path ...user}` - object spread, in the same way as javascript [ES6 spread operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_operator)


## Why?
I guess the best way to answer that is why not a HTML templating language like mustache? Basically these support loops and conditionals sql-stamp doesn't because I want the SQL to be kept clean and readable. It does however support a limited ternary switch for feature switches. Also it'll add in `?` as params so you can use your SQL libraries injection protection.


## Install

```sh
npm install sql-stamp --save
```

## API
The API is as follows

```js
var sqlStamp = require("sql-stamp");
var tmpl = sqlStamp([
  /* Pass a list of SQL templates */
  __dirname+"/friends.sql",
  __dirname+"/example.sql"
]).then(function(sql) {
  // 'sql' call with 'sql(pathToFile, args)' to exec the template
});

var files = glob.sync("./sql/**/*.sql")
sqlStamp(files).then(function(sql) {
  sql(__dirname+"../lib/sql/foo.sql", {foo: "bar"});
  // => {sql: "select...", args: ["bar"]}
});
```

So for example given the following SQL file which selects all friend requests you've accepted

```sql
/* ./friends.sql */
select * from friends where status = "accepted"
```

The following file can **require** this as a CTE (<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/queries-with.html>) via a require directive `{> ./file/path.sql}`

```sql
/* ./example.sql */
WITH friend AS (
  {> ./friends.sql}
)
select
  *
from
  account
where
  account.id = friend.toId
  AND friend.fromId = {accountId}
  AND (
    {?filterDisabled} OR {!filterKey} = {filterVal}
  )
```

When we run the following

```js
var out = tmpl(__dirname+"/example.sql", {
  accountId: 1,
  filterDisabled: false,
  filterKey: "role",
  filterVal: "dev"
});
```

The following will be returned

```js
{
  args: [1, "dev"],
  sql: SQL
}
```

Where `SQL` is

```sql
WITH friend AS (
  select * from friends where status = "active"
)
select
  *
from
  account
where
  account.id = friend.toId
  AND friend.fromId = ?
  AND (
    /*feature:filterDisabled*/ false AND role = ?
  )
```

## Errors
You'll get more descriptive errors about where the error happened in your source SQL. This can be disabled with `{prettyErrors: false}`

```
SQLError: Too many args

select
  *
from
  account
where
  foo = {too, many, args}
--------^
```

You can see some more examples in the tests here [here](test/errors/index.js)

## Sync API

sql-stamp has a synchronous API. This is useful for processing SQL templates and exporting from node modules.

```js
    var sqlStamp = require("sql-stamp/sync");
    var templater = sqlStamp([
      /* Pass a list of SQL templates */
      __dirname+"/friends.sql",
      __dirname+"/example.sql"
    ]);
    templater1(__dirname+"/example.sql", {foo: "bar"}); // => {sql: "select...", args: ["bar"]}

    var files = glob.sync("./sql/**/*.sql")
    var templater2 = sqlStamp(files);
    templater2(__dirname+"../lib/sql/foo.sql", {foo: "bar"}); // => {sql: "select...", args: ["bar"]}
```

## Test
Run the unit tests

```
npm test
```

Unit tests with code coverage

```
npm run coverage
```

And some really simple benchmarks

```
npm run benchmark
```
